hiya! I'm Lydia, or Dá ([达](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E8%BE%BE)). I'm a budding programmer and linguist. I'm originally from Chengdu, China and grew up in Windsor, Ontario.

### Currently,
I am at the [Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com/) for the Spring 2 batch! You will be privy to my experiences! / discoveries! / excitement! / utter confusion! if you read this here blog.

### Previously,
in reverse chronological order, I:
- worked on a [sketch grammar of Noongar](https://news.yale.edu/2017/08/01/program-spurs-students-do-detective-work-explore-aboriginal-languages) at Yale.
- graduated from [Carleton College](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carleton_College).
- wrote my senior thesis on the non-existence of why-clefts in Nukuoro.
- TA'ed for [Girls Who Code](https://girlswhocode.com/).
- went to Micronesia with the Linguistics Field School and contributed to the Nukuoro [Talking Dictionary](http://talkingdictionary.swarthmore.edu/nukuoro/).

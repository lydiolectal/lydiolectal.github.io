Tomorrow, my batch at the Recurse Center officially starts. Today, I attended a gathering for the women, non-binary, and trans* folk in Spring 1, 2 and the upcoming mini batch. (I think this is a wonderful thing and really shows how committed RC is to creating an equitable and welcoming environment for all.)

My understanding of RC prior to this meeting -- this thing I had decided to dedicate the greater part of three months of my life to -- was vague at best. Pretty much the only thing I was certain about was that I would be there for three months. What will I do / who will I meet / how on earth will I learn with "no structure" (there is the structure which you create for yourself) / is no one going to talk to me because I am not a super computer pro guru person (not even close)? All unclear. To be honest, I was slightly terrified and extremely nervous about being a relative newbie and an introvert.

And then. And then I met some genuine and brilliant people and they actually talked to me! I went intending to stay only for one or two hours, but ended up alternately talking / listening for ~four hours and nearly losing my voice. Naomi told me about something called "mildly context-sensitive grammars" that my linguist self is mildly embarrassed to admit I did not understand at all. Janice, Sarah, and I talked about arriving at programming from liberal arts backgrounds. I learned from Cheryl that a dairy sheep does not a good wool sheep make. I had a conversation with Brad about all the places we've lived and our paths to programming that had a lot of tangents that ended up leading back to the original topic. I learned that Chemex is a thing coffee snobs make coffee with. I learned that sleep is *really* important. There are so many cool-sounding events that RC-ers plan as well! I eavesdropped on a plan to have a programming "fail fest" at RC to normalize discussions about failure. And! I learned that RC has non-technical talks.

There are, of course, many other questions that remain unanswered; I still have yet to figure out exactly what I'm going to be doing for these three months and I'm sure I'll have to experiment with different strategies to optimize for learning and maintaining motivation. But for now, I am content. I want to crawl into this wonderful fuzzy feeling and live in it forever -- or at least until tomorrow morning.
